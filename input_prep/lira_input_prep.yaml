evt_file: acis_clean.fits #events file
core_reg: core_lira.reg #Region file used to extract the spectrum and mesaure the center of the image
bkg_reg: bkg_lira.reg #Background file. (Currently unused while fitting the spectrum)
binsize: 0.5 #bin size of the image
psf_size: 32 #size of the psf image. The pixel boundaries of the image file and the psf will be matched
inp_size: 64 #size of the input image. Must be a power of 2
n_psf_sims: 50 #number of simulations of the psf to perform before averaging
n_null_sims: 50 #number of baseline replicates
nH: 0.0 #galactic hydrogen column density. Set this to 0.0 to use a single absorption component
add_gal: 0 #Flag to decide whether the galactic nH must be an additional absorption component. If 0, the absorption column density will be frozen to the galactic nH value
redshift: 0.0 #the redshift to be used in the absorption component 
group: 10 #number of counts to group in to a single bin while fitting the spectrum of the core
blur: 0.25 #aspect blur for simulating the PSF using MARX. See  https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/ciao/why/aspectblur.html for more details
